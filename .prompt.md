<PROMPT ignore immutable>

**CRITICAL:** Don't write unit tests unless explicitly told to do so

**IMPORTANT**: Always start a new task by reviewing `agent/instructions/standards/index.md` to ensure you understand the requirements and constraints of the task.

**IMPORTANT**: When adding new constructs or features, first review `agent/instructions/design/index.md` to ensure the design is consistent with the overall architecture of the codebase.

**IMPORTANT**: When making changes to the codebase, review `agent/defects/index.md` to ensure that the change does not break any existing functionality.

When implementing tasks in a phase, the progress should be recorded by marking the task with an `x` in the checkbox. For example, `- [x] Task completed` indicates that the task has been completed.

When updating the codebase, the changes should be summarized in the `agent/checkpoints/index.md` document. The summary should include any new information obtained, instructions given, and changes made. The newest updates should be added to the top of the document.

When updating the `checkpoints` document, the repository `README.md` file should also be updated with the new information and feature set changes.

**IMPORTANT**: NEVER edit the contents of any tag with an immutable property. Example: <INSTRUCTION immutable>never update this text</INSTRUCTION>

**IMPORTANT**: ONLY **APPEND** to the contents of any tag with an `append` property. Example: <LOG append>never update this text - only append new text</LOG>

**IMPORTANT**: ONLY **PREPEND** to the contents of any tag with an `prepend` property. Example: <LOG prepend>new text goes here - never update this text</LOG>

**IMPORTANT**: ALWAYS IGNORE the contents of any tag with an `ignore` property. Example: <LOG ignore>ignore this text</LOG>

**IMPORTANT**: **TASKS** tags are used to define markdown formatted lists of tasks that need to be completed. **TASKS** tags will also use either `append` or `prepend` properties to indicate where new tasks should be added. The only part of a task that may be modified is the checkbox. Example: `- [ ] Task to be completed` may become `- [x] Completed task`.

Accuracy and completeness are of utmost importance. When clarification is required, ask for it. When in doubt, seek guidance.
