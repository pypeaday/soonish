## Documentation Guidelines

When documenting the codebase, please ensure that the following guidelines are followed:
- **IMPORTANT:** The single most important piece of information to convey to the user is the purpose of the code.
- Documentation must be written in a clear and concise manner.
- All functions should have docstrings, all arguments should be type-hinted
- All other documentation must be written in markdown.
