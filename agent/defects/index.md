# Defects Log

## 2024-12-18: Authentication Implementation

### Issue 1: Settings Model Validation Error
- **Description**: The application failed to start due to a validation error in the Settings model
- **Root Cause**: The `.env` file contained a `NOTIFICATION_PROVIDER` setting that wasn't defined in the Settings model
- **Fix**: Added `notification_provider` field to the Settings model in `config.py`
- **Prevention**: Always ensure that any environment variables used in the application are properly defined in the Settings model
- **Impact**: Application startup was failing with a Pydantic validation error
- **Resolution**: Added the missing field with proper typing (Optional[str])

### Issue 2: Authentication 401 Error
- **Description**: Users were getting 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing the homepage
- **Root Cause**: All routes were requiring authentication, including public routes like the login page
- **Fix**: 
  1. Made authentication optional for the homepage
  2. Updated auth system to use cookies instead of Authorization header
  3. Fixed OAuth callback URLs to use proper router path generation
  4. Added proper template rendering for login page
- **Prevention**: 
  1. Clearly identify which routes should be public vs protected
  2. Test authentication flow with both authenticated and unauthenticated users
  3. Verify OAuth callback URLs match the provider configuration
- **Impact**: Users couldn't access any part of the application, including the login page
- **Resolution**: Implemented proper public/private route handling and fixed OAuth configuration

### Issue 3: Database Schema Error
- **Description**: OAuth login failed with SQLite error about missing user_id column
- **Root Cause**: Database schema was out of sync with model changes (adding User-Event relationship)
- **Fix**: 
  1. Updated database initialization to drop and recreate tables
  2. Fixed model relationships and cascade behavior
  3. Ensured Base model is shared between database and models modules
- **Prevention**: 
  1. Use database migrations for schema changes in production
  2. Test database schema changes with fresh database creation
  3. Keep model relationships consistent across the codebase
- **Impact**: Users couldn't log in as the database schema was outdated
- **Resolution**: Recreated database with updated schema including user relationships

### Issue 4: Session Middleware Missing
- **Description**: OAuth login failed with assertion error about missing SessionMiddleware
- **Root Cause**: OAuth requires session support for storing temporary state during authentication flow
- **Fix**: Added SessionMiddleware to FastAPI application using the same secret key as JWT
- **Prevention**: 
  1. Review middleware requirements for third-party libraries
  2. Test authentication flow in development before deployment
  3. Keep track of dependencies between different authentication components
- **Impact**: OAuth authentication flow was failing immediately
- **Resolution**: Added required session middleware for OAuth support

### Issue 5: Database Session Dependency Error
- **Description**: OAuth callback failed with AttributeError on session execution
- **Root Cause**: FastAPI dependency injection was not properly handling the database session
- **Fix**: 
  1. Fixed session dependency in get_current_user function
  2. Made User return type optional for better error handling
  3. Added explicit session parameter usage in auth functions
- **Prevention**: 
  1. Test dependency injection chains thoroughly
  2. Use proper typing for better error detection
  3. Document dependencies between functions
- **Impact**: OAuth callback was failing after successful provider authentication
- **Resolution**: Fixed dependency injection and session handling in auth module

### Issue 6: Optional User Session Error
- **Description**: Homepage failed with AttributeError on session execution in get_optional_user
- **Root Cause**: Database session was not properly passed through the dependency chain
- **Fix**: 
  1. Added session parameter to get_optional_user function
  2. Updated index route to include session dependency
  3. Fixed session parameter passing in auth functions
- **Prevention**: 
  1. Ensure all async functions have proper dependency injection
  2. Test authentication flows with both authenticated and unauthenticated users
  3. Document dependency requirements for helper functions
- **Impact**: Homepage was failing to load due to session handling error
- **Resolution**: Fixed session dependency injection throughout the authentication chain
